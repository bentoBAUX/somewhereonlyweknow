            <p>Happy 19th Birthday, my darling~ <i>*sigh* *admires beb*</i> How the hell did I even win myself such an amazing girl like you?
            <i>*cup your face*</i> So devilishly beautiful yet so adorably sweet~ You put me at ease in the most troublesome of times, my
            beeg comfy pillow in thunderstorm :D Never have I ever felt so loved when I'm around you (especially in that Xmas
            painting, as much as I hate to admit it). Darling, I am so grateful for you.
            <br><br>
            It has only been 10 months but it feels like I've known you all my life! Yet at the same time, there is so much for us
            to discover together. Both in the world and within ourselves. I SAY! <i>*raises a glass of mango juice*</i> HERE'S TO OUR
            HUMBLE LITTLE BEGINNING! <i>*clinks with beb's choco milk*</i>
            <br><br>
            <i>*holds beb's hand*</i> We start this journey together, we'll finish it with each other by our sides. I'll stay with you
            through all life's sorrows and delights and love you with an intensity of a star. Have a wonderful 19th year, my love. I
            love you so much. <i>*muuuuuuuack*</i></p>
